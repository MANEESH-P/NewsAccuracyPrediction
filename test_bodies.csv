1,"Amid the Avengers: Endgame frenzy, Taylor Swift announced the release of her new single and music video during an interview with Robin Roberts in Nashville, that aired live on ABC during NLF Draft on Thursday night.

The announcement sent Swifties in a tizzy and they couldn't be happier to finally decode the secret behind her recent cryptic Instagram posts filled with pastel shade props -- from rainbow dresses, glitter, butterflies and heart-shaped diamonds. The change in the vibe from her edgy, bold black-and-white pictures that defined her Reputation-era aesthetic to brighter, rainbow-centric hues is clearly hard to miss.

The song is called ""ME!"" and it features Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco. Panic also confirmed the track on Twitter, writing ""Sooooo, this is happening!"" and linking to Swift's YouTube where the video will premiere at midnight EST. The collaboration between the two artistes has now got fans all excited, especially from the LGBTQ community.

Panic! At the Disco's Brendon Urie, who came out as Pansexual in 2018, pledged $1 million to LGBT youth during the Pride Month last year. Swift too recently donated $113,000 to Tennessee LGBTQ advocacy group who oppose a series of bills moving inside the state's Republican-controlled General Assembly, which they say target LGBTQ individuals.

""It's about embracing your individuality and celebrating it and owning it,"" Swift told Roberts of ""ME!"" ""With a pop song, we have the ability to get a melody stuck in people's heads. I just want it to be one that makes them feel better about themselves."""

Swift thanked the artist who created the mural in an Instagram post on Thursday. She also thanked her fans for showing up, saying: ""I've never been more proud of your FBI level detective skills.""

""The fans are amazing. I can't believe how dedicated they are,"" Swift told Roberts. ""I can't believe how much they care -- so it makes it more fun more for me to create music, to create music videos.""

Swift's last album was ""Reputation,"" which released in 2017."
3,"The ceremony also witnessed Khalid hit the stage for his performance in celebration of being an honoree of the TIME 100 list. Together, the singers followed the footsteps of Jennifer Lopez and Shawn Mendes, who delivered show-stopping performances at the 2018 gala.

Mendes even penned a poetic message for Swift as she was announced as one of the honorees for this year's TIME 100. ""I quickly learned that the magic of Taylor Swift doesn't come from the lights, dancers or fireworks (although all of that is incredible),"" he wrote, ""but from the electrifying connection that she has with the people who are there to see her.""

Swift joins the likes of Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga, Michelle Obama, Sandra Oh, and K-pop band BTS, who have all been include in the TIME 100 list.

Apart from this, Taylor's mysterious countdown to 26 April on social media is continuing to puzzle her fans. Swifters believe she will be dropping a new album, single or music video."

Each celebrity is featured alongside a blurb written by another prominent figure. Troye Sivan, who wrote about Ariana Grande said that the pop star is ""breaking the rules and is a force who understands how music should work in 2019.""

Shawn Mendes, who has toured with Swift praised her, ""She's the master of putting the perfect amount of thought into not overthinking, and that's why her music connects so well.""

Celine Dion lauded Lady Gaga campaigning for LGBTQ rights and said she was ""powerful, convincing, passionate and sensitive."" Dion further called The Star is Born actor and pop star ""one of the most inventive artists"" and lauded her creativity.

Halsey, recently seen with BTS in the collaborative single 'Boy With Luv' said, ""Surely it takes remarkable talent, charm, kindness, altruism and dedication. But you'd still be missing a key component: a devoted community to uplift your efforts, soften your stumbles and shoot light from their eyes into the sky in your name every single night. By these parameters, BTS has reached the top."""
5,"Time released its 2019 list of the 100 most influential people in the world on Wednesday.

Priyanka Chopra also wrote a profile about lawyers Menaka Guruswamy and Arundhati Katju, and Justin Timberlake wrote a bit for Tiger Woods."
6,"Singer Taylor Swift has donated $113,000 to fight anti-LGBTQ legislation in her home state of Tennessee.

On Monday, the singer donated $113,000 to LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) advocacy group called the Tennessee Equality Project (TEP).

Chris Sanders, TEP's executive director, announced the donation through a Facebook post.

""Taylor Swift has been a long-time ally to the LGBTQ community,"" Sanders wrote in the post, which included an image of the letter that accompanied Swift's donation. She sees our struggle in Tennessee and continues to add her voice with so many good people, including religious leaders, who are speaking out for love in the face of fear.""

Swift said in the letter, dated April 8, that she felt inspired by the organisation's work combating a proposed series of anti-LGBTQ bills in the Tennessee General Assembly.

TEP describes the bills as a slate of hate and say they promote state-sanctioned discrimination.

According to an American magazine's website, the legislation being considered includes ones that allow private adoption agencies to raise religious and moral objections over prospective parents, and another that prevents state and local governments from taking actions against a business based on its internal policies.

Other legislation is aimed at transgender individuals, including one that requires the state to defend school districts that require students to use the bathroom of their assigned sex at birth."
7,"Pop star Taylor Swift has made a significant donation to an LGBT advocacy group in her adopted state of Tennessee, reports Variety. Swift contributed $1113,000 (£86,000) to the Tennessee Equality Project (TEP) after being moved by their work towards fighting certain anti-LGBTQ bills in the area.

Criticised as ""slate for hate"" bills, the directives talk about the Tennessee Natural Marriage Act banning gay marriages in the state and changing the laws related to nudity in locker rooms.

Chris Sanders, TEP's executive director, shared news of Swift's donation on Facebook along with a her letter which goes on to explain Swift's stance.

The 29-year-old broke her long-standing silence regarding politics in October 2018. Swift wrote a detailed post on Instagram stating that the Republican Party's candidates' stance on LGBT issues was a major factor in her choice of backing Democratic candidates in November's mid-term elections."
8,"The Indian publishing industry is not just surviving, it is thriving, but who's reading?

In a country where a new 'bestseller' crops up every week and MBAs dominate the writing scene, it is becoming increasingly difficult to tell fact from fiction. Problems such as lack of sales data consolidation, faulty distribution channels, the e-commerce boom, and faltering profit margins are just a few roadblocks publishers are tackling here.

As they fight to find innovative ways to develop and groom a larger readership, it's clear the industry is in dire need of intervention. While researching her new book, How To Get Published In India, Meghna Pant spoke to publishers, authors, industry stalwarts and stakeholders to understand the hush-hush world of publishing. Excerpts from an interview:

From lack of accurate sales data to broken distribution channels, the industry has a lot of problems. How do you think these affect the publishers?

Publishing is a business like any other, and what most people don't know is that a publisher's margins are pretty slim.

They have to pay authors, distributors, retailers, printers, editors, designers, staff etc. They are also finding ways to cope with roadblocks such as the dwindling interest of readers in genres such as literary fiction.

From publishing new genres and finding new voices, to relying on established names, to selling film and television rights and finding professional vendors, publishers are reinventing the wheel in many ways.

Publishers are feeling the pressure to put out more books each year, but this has skewed the supply-demand ratio. Do you think this model is a sustainable way forward or will smaller publishers be affected?

According to the India Book Market Report (2016), India is the sixth largest publisher in the world overall, and the second largest publisher in the world for English-language books. That's huge! Led by educational books, publishing is a $6.76 billion sector expected to grow at an astounding 19.3% until 2020 (Nielsen Report, 2016). This means almost 250 books are published per day. 55% sales are of English books, 35% of Hindi, and the rest are regional-language books. 65% of English-language sales come from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. Also, contrary to popular perception, on an average, Indians read around 2.1 books a week. According to World Culture Score Index, Indians spend more time reading than their counterparts globally.

So I don't think supply-demand is an issue; smaller publishers are cropping up almost everywhere. A good book will find a good audience no matter who the publisher is.

There's a big issue with data consolidation in the publishing sector. At best, the numbers are usually approximations. Why does this problem persist?

A lack of checks and balances, like with most industries in India. Hopefully, things will get more transparent with time. Until then, authors have no choice but to trust their publishers when it comes to, say, sales numbers or book availability or other important data.

How do bestseller lists and awards affect sales?

Most bestsellers today follow a cut and paste formula -- write in simple language, devise fast-paced narratives with plenty of emotions and drama, identify a specific market, target the customer, keep the price point of the book between ₹99 and ₹150, market well, and, most importantly, track the product.

It's rather worrisome that literature in India has become this formulaic. Authors are cashing in on trends like campus

novels, mythology or self-help, and no one is pushing the envelope. If nothing new is being said or written, books will not have any transformative or evocative power. It will take the focus away from writing good books to selling bad books. In this way, the bestselling phenomenon corrupts writing. It focuses on gaming the system. Indians today are reading the bestselling books, not the best books. The bestseller label can't be the only criterion for buying a book. Check the author's writing credentials, see how many awards they've won, if they've been published abroad.

How important is it for publishers to embrace technological advancements considering e-book sales still haven't surpassed physical sales and audiobooks haven't taken off the way experts predicted?

Let's take a look at some numbers: 90% of all books published in India sell less than 2,000 copies a year. A paltry 9% sell between 2,000 to 10,000 copies, and -- hold your breath -- less than 1% sell more than 10,000 copies. The number sounds ridiculous, but we are a population of almost a billion and a half. A book is typically considered a bestseller when it crosses the coveted 10,000 mark within a year of publication. Despite technological advances, digital revenue is still only 3-4% of total sales. The answer is in the facts.

What is the future of publishing? Will it grow, plateau, or will we see its downfall?

Whether you're writing mythological fiction, crime thrillers or self-help books, there has never been a better or worse time to be an author. Why? Because it's easy to get published but difficult to sell. Authors are fighting for the reader's attention not only with other authors, but also with Pokémon and Taylor Swift and WhatsApp. We are questioning whether people are even reading any more. We are wondering whether the rise of commercial fiction has beckoned the end of literary fiction. There's so much flux.

Do these changes spell the death knoll for publishing? No. Today we have three generations of English-speaking Indians, who are hungry to read. They are particularly hungry to read in English. This trend will continue to grow. With every new generation we will see a bigger readership market. On top of that, the closed ranks of the literary world have opened up. A person can publish a book within minutes thanks to the advent of self-publishing. So, the industry in India is not just surviving, it is thriving.

How do you think new-age content consumption platforms are helping?

TV shows and web channels keep a lookout for interesting books. If they think the book is commercially viable as a TV show or web series, they contact the author or publisher. If they think the book is not commercially viable but the writer can add value to their show, they ask the author to become a part of the writing team without buying the book rights. Fortunately, new-age content creators are looking for good content, which means publishers can see a direct pay-off. It's win-win for everyone: author, publisher, reader, platform and audience."
9,"Over the years, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift have shared a love-hate relationship. In 2017, Perry had said she is ready to move on from the fight and only wished best for her.

Singer Katy Perry says she is ""open"" to work with Taylor Swift for a new track.

In an interview with Entertainment Tonight on the sidelines of iHeartRadio Music Awards, the 34-year-old singer was asked whether she would be open to collaborating with Swift. The two were frenemies for a long time.

To this, Perry replied, ""I'm open! Open, open, open!""

Last year, they ended their feud after the ""Bon Appetite"" hitmaker sent a surprise package to Swift requesting for her forgiveness.

Over the years, the two singers have shared a love-hate relationship.

In 2017, Perry had said she is ready to move on from the fight and only wished best for her.

Swift was accused by Perry, who claimed the former had sabotaged her tour by stealing her backing dancers.

Earlier, Swift wrote the song ""Bad Blood"" about their fight and Perry seemed to hit back with her single ""Swish Swish""."
